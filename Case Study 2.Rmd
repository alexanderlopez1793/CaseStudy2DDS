# Introduction
In this analysis we will be reviewing and interpreting variables and characteristics of employee Attrition, or turn over. We will examine data with variables such as, wage, satisfaction poll scores, employee department, and so on. The objectives of the analysis will be to determine the 3 top factors contributing to Attrition, report on job role specific trends, identify other key insight, and finally, build prediction models for attrition and wage for employees that quit.

## Insights: 

- Attrition: Data is somewhat biased with a majority (84%) of employees showing "No" to Attrition (turnover).
- Business Travel: Most employees (71%) rarely travel.
- Department: Almost 2/3 (65%) of employees work in "Research & Development".
- Education Field: Employees with "Life Sciences" and "Medical" education backgrounds make up almost 3/4 of data (72%).
- Gender: Employees are 59% male.
- Job Role: 60% of employees work as "Sales Executive", "Research Scientist", or "Laboratory Technician".
- Marital Status: There is almost a 50/50 split between "Married" and "Single"/"Divorced" employees ("Divorced" employees can be considered single as well).
- Overtime: 71% of employees do not work overtime.

## Insights: 

- Age: Employee age has approx. normally distribution.
- Hourly/Daily/Monthly Rate: There is no obvious statistical distribution.
- Distance From Home: There is a right skew with a large amount of employees living very close to work.
- Education: There is a some-what normal distribution around mid-level education (assumption is 5 is the highest level of education i.e. PHD, and 1 is equal to little or no post high school education).
- Environment Satisfaction: A majority of employees have high work satisfaction (3 or 4 rating).
- Job Involvement: Most employees have mid-range job involvement (assumption is 1 is low involvement and 4 is high involvement).
- Job Level: There is a right skew with a majority of employees having lower level jobs.
- Job Satisfaction: A majority of employees have high levels of job satisfaction.
- Monthly Income: There is a right skew with, what seems to be, positive outliers (high wages).
- Number of Companies Worked: There is a right skew, with a large number of employees having only worked 1 other job.
- Percent Salary Hike: There is a right skew, with a majority of employees recieving low salary percentage increases.
- Performance Rating: Scale is likely from 1-5, meaning all employees show to have mid to mid-high ratings.
- Relationship Satisfaction: A majority of employees have high relationship satisfaction with there supervisor/manager (assumption is 1 is low satisfaction and 4 is high satisfaction).
- Stock Option: Most employees have low level stock option plan, likely correlating to high number of employees with lower Job Level.
- Total Working Years: There is a right skew, with positive outliers appearing to be present.
- Training Total Last Year: Most employees only trained 2-3 times last year.
- Work/Life Balance: A majority of employees show to have a good level of work/life balance (assumption 1 is bad work/life balance and 4 is good work/life balance).
- Years at Company: There is right skew, likely correlates to number of total years worked.
- Years in Current Role: Some what right skew, could also be bi-modal around 2 years and 7 years.
- Years Since Last Promotion: There is a right skew, may have strong correlation to years in current role.
- Years With Current Manager: Some what right skew, could also be bi-modal. Distribution looks very similar to years in current role.

## Insights:

- Age: over 75% of Employees that quit were under 40.
- Hourly/Daily/Monthly Rate: No noticeable trends, when comparing rates and carrying them over to days and then months, the Attrition values do not equal each other.
- Distance From Home: Attrition rate was higher for those employees who did not travel far for work.
- Education: Attrition rate is highest among employees with lowest score.
- Environment Satisfaction: Attrition rates are highest among employees with the lowest environment satisfaction score.
- Job Involvement: Attrition rates are highest among employees with lowest job involvement.
- Job Level: Attrition rates are highest in lowest job level, but rates follow same overall distribution.
- Job Satisfaction: Attrition rates are highest among employees with low job satisfaction score.
- Monthly Income: 75% of employees who quit had monthly incomes of 6000 or less.
- Number of Companies Worked: Attrition rate was highest among employees who had only worked one job before, but that may be biased since a that subgroup is a strong majority.
- Percent Salary Hike: Attrition rates were highest among employees with the lowest salary increases by percentage.
- Performance Rating: Most employees had performance ratings of 3 so the increased attrition rate is expected.
- Relationship Satisfaction: Attrition rates are highest among employees with low relationship satisfaction.
- Stock Option: Employees with the lowest stock option plan, had the highest attrition rate.
- Total Working Years: 75% of the employees that quit, had 10 or less working years.
- Training Total Last Year: Attrition rates appear to follow same overall distribution for training times.
- Work/Life Balance: Attrition rate is highest for employees with lowest Work/Life Balance.
- Years at Company: Over 75% of the employees that quit, had been with the company for less than 9 years.
- Years in Current Role: Over 75% of the employees that quit, had only been in their current role for less than 5 years.
- Years Since Last Promotion: Over 75% of the employees that quit, had just been promoted in the last 3 years.
- Years With Current Manager: Over 75% of the employees that quit, had worked with their last manager for 6 years or less.

# Top 3 Factors

# find strongest correlations with Attrition and plot correlation matrix
corr_data1 = model.matrix(~0+., data=mod_data) %>% cor(use="pairwise.complete.obs")
corr_data1 = as.data.frame(corr_data1)
corr_data1 %>% filter(AttritionYes> .07) %>% ggcorrplot(show.diag = F, type="lower", lab=TRUE, lab_size=4, show.legend = TRUE, title = "Correlation Matrix")
# overtime,job role (sales rep), marital status (single)
```

## Insights: 

The Top 3 Factors for Attrition are listed below:

- Overtime (Corr = 0.27): Whether or not an employee works overtime has the highest correlation to Attrition. Overtime is work outside of the standard 40 hour work week. Being over worked as an employee can certainly lead to distraught feelings and eventually, voluntary turnover. 
- Job Role, Sales Representative (Corr = 0.20): Job Role, more specifically, Sales Representative has the second highest correlation to Attrition. Looking at the bi-variate analysis, sales rep employees had the highest attrition rate at 45%. This percentage is amplified when considering sales reps make up only 6% of the total employee population. 
- Marital Status, Single (Corr = 0.18): Single Employees had the third highest correlation to Attrition. One thought process can be, employees with no family are more inclined to take risks, such as quitting to become entrepreneurs or moving to another company.

```

## Insights:

- Sales Representatives have the lowest mean monthly income (2653), lowest mean education level (2.45) and are the least experienced employees with a mean of 2.9 years with the company.
- Mangers and Research Directors have the highest mean monthly incomes (17197 and 15750 respectively) and are the most experienced employees with 13.8 and 10.2 years with the company.
- Healthcare Representatives have the highest mean job satisfaction score (2.83), even with the highest mean distance from home (9.8).

## Insights

- In general, jobs with higher wages tend to have better employee retention. In this case, job satisfaction did not appear have significant impact on attrition - Managers and Directors saw very little attrition regardless of satisfaction score. Overall, this plot provides evidence that if the company wants to decrease attrition, the best course of action will likely be to increase wages.

## Insights:

- KNN Model Results: 
  - Accuracy = 78%
  - Sensitivity = 91%
  - Specificity = 7%
- Naive Bayes Model Results: 
  - Accuracy = 72%
  - Sensitivity = 70%
  - Specificity = 83%
- Naive Bayes model provided required metric scores and so can be used as our Attrition classification model.

# Regression Model
```{r}
# training/test sets have already been created
# creating model - linear regression
model2 = lm(MonthlyIncome ~ Age + YearsAtCompany + JobLevel, data=train)
summary(model2)

# predictions
model2_preds = predict(model2,newdata = test)
#as.data.frame(model2_preds)

# using rmse function, RMSE= 1372.05
rmse(test$MonthlyIncome,model2_preds)

# creating another model - linear regression w/ years at company removed due to high p-value
model3 = lm(MonthlyIncome ~ Age + JobLevel, data=train)
summary(model3)

# predictions
model3_preds = predict(model3,newdata = test)
#as.data.frame(model3_preds)

# using rmse function, RMSE= 1372.05
rmse(test$MonthlyIncome,model3_preds)

```

## Insights:

- Linear Regression model yields RMSE = 1372.05. Variables to considered were selected after reviewing data during EDA. Job Level seems to hold the most significance when predicting monthly income (p-value = <2e-16).

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the top 3 factors for attrition were identified to be over time work, job role (sales rep), and marital status (single). Further analysis and interpretation was also provided for specific job roles like sales rep and managers. Insight on attrition reduction was also provied. Finally, 2 models that meet the given criteria were identified. For attrition classification, the Naive Bayes will provide metric scores over 70% and for a monthly income prediction, the linear regression model will provide an RMSE less than $1375.
